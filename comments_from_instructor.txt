COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

Nice work on this, Rowan, and that *is* a decent collection of music!

x.add(new Song("Daft Punk", "End of Line", 156));
x.add(new Song("Arctic Monkeys", "Teddy Picker", 160));
x.add(new Song("$20", "Boygenius", 320));
x.add(new Song("alt-J", "Philadelphia", 218));
x.add(new Song("Magdalena Bay", "You Lose!", 204));

You inspired me to dust off the old MP3s from the Tron Legacy soundtrack,
and now we'll be listening to those in class next week! :)

I added a .gitignore file so that tracking is turned off for those
annoying .class and .ctxt files.

Accept this pull request and you'll be all done. Congratulations!

SCORE: 20
